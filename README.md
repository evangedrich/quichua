# quichua
A language learning tool for Ecuadorian Quichua.

This is an adaptation of the document <i>Introduction to Central Highland Quichua of Ecuador, or Quichua in Ten Easy Lessons (the other 40 are harder)</i> by Ellen M. Ross, prepared by Richard P. Aschmann, intended as a digital aid to learning spoken Ecuadorian Quichua with a Quichua-language tutor.
